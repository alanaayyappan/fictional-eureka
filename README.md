## Welcome to React Frontend Challenge!

### The Problem

Challenge is to create a jokes app with dark mode. Use the Chuck Norris jokes API [api.chucknorris.io](api.chucknorris.io)  to generate random Jokes. A new request fetches **ten** new Jokes. It should be appended to the old ones and displayed on the screen.

You can use [fetch api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) or [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) with react or javascript to make API calls. Sending a GET request to  [api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random](api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random) generates a random joke.

A dark mode toggler button should change the theme of the app. The dark theme changes the background color to black, and the text changes to white (or any other color of choice).

### Things to keep in Mind #Rules

You can create the app with React Framework. If you don't know React, use plain old javascript (Please don't use JQuery).

Maintain a clean commit history and add comments wherever necessary. The code should be easily readable.

Try your best to complete the challenge. This challenge is curated to tests your skills in DOM manipulation and making REST API calls which is very important for this project.

Even if you could not complete the challenge, do whatever you can but with perfection.

Try to keep the app simple, easy to use, and beautifulðŸ˜‹.

Happy Coding!
